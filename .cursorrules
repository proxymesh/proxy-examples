# Cursor Rules for proxy-examples

## Git Configuration
- Always commit as `cursor@proxymesh.com` with name `Cursor`
- Run these commands if not already configured:
  ```
  git config user.email "cursor@proxymesh.com"
  git config user.name "Cursor"
  ```
- NEVER push directly to main - always create a branch and PR
- NEVER bypass branch protection rules
- If a push is rejected due to branch protection, create a PR instead

## Pull Requests
- Do NOT add "Made with Cursor" or similar footers to PR descriptions
- After creating a PR with `gh pr create`, immediately run `gh pr edit <number> --body "..."` to ensure no footer was appended
- Keep PR descriptions concise and focused on the changes

## Code Style
- Follow existing code patterns in the repository
- Keep examples simple and focused on demonstrating the feature
- Include comments linking to documentation
